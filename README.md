## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer who lives and breathes code. If you’re looking for someone obsessed with **React**, fluent in **Java**, conversant with **SQL** and **PHP**, you’re in the right place.

My idea of fun? Building, debugging, and optimizing—then pushing boundaries a little further.

## 🛠️ My Tech Toolbox

- **React** – Dynamic UIs, component wizardry
- **Java** – Robust backends, enterprise magic
- **SQL** – Data wrangling, query artistry
- **PHP** – Web apps, fast and flexible
